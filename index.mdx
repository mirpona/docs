I'm interviewing for the role of your first Customer Success Manager. This is not my first rodeo building out a successful Customer Success organization!

I'm currently at Tabnine, so I'm comfortable with AI product startups. I've also worked at Hashicorp, Cloudant, and IBM.

I live in San Francisco and enjoy traveling and film photography. I most recently went to Greece and Malta.
