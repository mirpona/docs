What would you need to learn to qualify if this is real?

</Card>

I would discuss with the customer:

- Are the current documentation interaction metrics giving them the expected user experience for each product, especially the Cloud platform and AI navigator API sections?
- Is there user, developer or business feedback on the documentation as being too complex or insufficient?
- Have they been using Agent to manage the documentation? Do they need assistance with defining internal workflows to increase documentation updates?
- Are there non-developer user types who need to update the documentation whose needs are not being met by the dashboard editor? 
- Are there any blockers to configuring the live API endpoint setup with the AI navigator and Desktop API documentation? Are there technical or other limitations?
