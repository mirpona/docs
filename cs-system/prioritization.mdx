What is the first step you would take to solve the age-old problem of engineering resource constraints and enterprise customers who want new features shipped urgently?

## Internal processes for CS team 

Customer Success is the connective tissue that brings Engineering, Product, Sales and the Customer together. It is critically important to build out robust internal processes that enable issue triage and prioritization to be handled smoothly.

Typical internal processes include a method for the customer-facing teams and the engineering teams to async determine the two poles of any feature work: business need and internal resources to deliver.

When it comes to issues that require prioritization the CSM must always gather the following from the customer before going to Product/Engineering:

- Issue summary with clear problem description and, if known, suggested solution
- Business justification: Is this blocking additional expansion? Will delivering this feature lead to an increase in revenue? If so, how much? Will not delivering it result in a loss of revenue? If so, how much? Timeline for gain/loss?
- Severity: How critical is this issue? Immediate major revenue loss (critical), eventual loss (high), nice to have (low)?
- Is there an existing workaround? This will lower Severity
- An understanding from the customer of an acceptable solution
- Customer's expectations/needs for delivery: need to deliver by certain date, can use workaround until When

## Integration with partner teams (Product, Engineering)

With this information the CSM will create some type of issue ticket that the engineering team can review. The Engineering team will offer a timeline, alternate solution, or backlog the request. 

There should be some standing meeting or discussion forum between CS and the Engineering/Product team to regularly review the requests and backlog. Some issues are important enough to discuss directly for rapid triage and prioritization, but most issues can be put on an issue tracker and discussed once a week. 

## Business justification and Engineering priority

A pattern of mutual respect between the Engineering and CS teams should be established from the beginning: the CS team will respect Engineering's priority on feature/fix delivery, and Engineering will respect CS's business justification for the need.

The CSM will discuss the proposed solution and timeline with the customer and manage expectations accordingly. The Engineering team should take into account the business/revenue justification when determining their internal priority for resolution.
