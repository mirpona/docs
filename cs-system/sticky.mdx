3. What are the stickiest features of our product? How do you think about preventing churn re: those features?
</Card>


## Sticky features

I believe the stickiest features of the product are:

- Assistant: Reviewing the customer studies and their sites it looks like the Assistant is the most consistently-adopted feature
- API integration + MCP: The ease of setup and easy creation of an MCP server are invaluable as many products roll out agents and AI tooling
- docs-as-code workflow: For organizations who rely on developers to write the documentation, this is critical 
- potentially, Agent: A lot of customers in general are interested in automated docs updates with AI, but for real Enterprise adoption you would need stronger governance and customization (such as allowing customer to connect to their own LLM endpoints) 

See [suggested features](expansion/#suggested-features) for more thoughts on features that would increase stickiness for Enterprise customers.

## Churn prevention

It's not really an exaggeration that most of the CSM job is really about churn prevention!

I consider this part of building out the daily CSM processes:

- the [customer health metrics](metrics#customer-health-metrics) should show drops in usage that could indicate churn
- regular cadence calls to discuss new features allow the CSM to gauge customer sentiment and listen for indications there are competitor or feature gaps
- robust internal processes to handle [prioritization](pritoritization) and ensure the internal customer->product->engineering feedback loop is fully utilized
