2. What in your opinion are the expansion levers for our product? How would you systematically drive that expansion across our customers?
</Card>


## Current expansion levers

Currently Mintlify prices primarily by deployment with an add-on fee for additional Dashboard-access seats and overages for Assistant and Agent usage.

Expansion then is driven primarily by deploying additional sites and seats, and secondarily by driving usage of features that can incur usage fees.


### suggested features

*enterprise-related*
  - additional git provider support (Azure Dev Ops, Bitbucket)
  - private repos/authenticated MCP/API
  - additional role types
    - product, business
  - bring your own API keys for assistant messages and agent
  - deploy in their own vpc
  - open source model connector support
  - SAML and SCIM 2.0 support
  - additional Agent integrations (MS Teams)

*context-related*
  - tooling for product or business updates to docs (different dashboard/permissions) and internal documentation
  - context connections to non-source code knowledge base (product requirements)


## Adoption plan

Adoption and expansion is part of the overall customer journey. I usually work to construct something like the following:

1. Customer signs deal
2. CSM/Support provision all access, CSM confirms all admins can access and provides initial setup guidance
3. CSM and Customer have kickoff call to establish Adoption Plan based on customer goals
4. CSM provides training enablement to all admins and advises on any customer questions/issues with setup or migration
5. CSM tracks progress on Adoption Plan with customer at QBR 
6. CSM engages with customer on regular cadence to discuss new release features and keep up to date with customer experience and sentiment
7. CSM works to get customer to 100% FAR and, if that is not possible, fully understand why that is not possible.

## Additional comments on the customer journey

The customer journey should be mapped by the CS team to identify where it makes sense to regularly probe for increased adoption and expansion. Each milestone on the customer journey should have playbooks for the CSM to follow with collateral prepared so interaction with customers is standardized and can be scaled. 

For example, a customer with 75%-100% FAR should be probed for other sites they're interesting in connecting to Mintlify. 

It should be a standing goal of the CS team to drive all customer deployments to 100% FAR and add more features to the FAR metric as the product matures.

One risk is that driving expansion by more deployments and few other levers can be difficult to grow consistently. You may want to consider more feature that require additional charge or breaking out pricing by seat type (assuming you add more types of seats).
