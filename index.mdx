I'm interviewing for the role of your first Customer Success Manager. 

I'm currently at Tabnine, so I'm comfortable with AI product startups. I've also worked at Hashicorp, Cloudant, and IBM. I've successfully scaled success teams twice now, most recently for Tabnine, and I'd love to bring my skills to assist with Mintlify's growth.

I live in San Francisco and enjoy traveling and film photography. I most recently went to Greece and Malta.
