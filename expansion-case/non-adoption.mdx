Why do you think they haven't adopted this yet?

</Card>

Anaconda has a very complex product portfolio. While it may not make sense to have API integration with all of their product offerings, they have several where it does, such as the Desktop API.

There may be complexity issues preventing API integration, such as needing special authentication types.

There may be issues due to the complexity of the documentation itself (lack of internal resources to drive a documentation initiative).
