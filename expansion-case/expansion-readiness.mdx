What signals would indicate expansion readiness?

</Card>

I would look for the following signals from Anaconda during qualification and cadence discussions:

*Major signals*

- Discussing initiatives to improve documentation
- Willingness to explore changes in the documentation to improve end user sentiment based on dashbard analytics or other 
- Interest or willingness in discussing any challenges to connecting to live API endpoints or content organization

*Minor signals*

- Discussing issues related to non-developer role types managing documentation 
  - This would more likely lead to more dashboard seats but it may be key to unblocking reorganization needed for additional sites!
- Interest or willingness to discuss internal workflow changes to increase their documentation updates with Agent
