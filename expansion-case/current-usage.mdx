What stands out about how they're using Mintlify?

</Card>

Anaconda has always been one of those products that I've feared needing to consult their docs because they have a huge number of products.

Reviewing their current docs site, it is much better with Mintlify than I recall last time I had to consult it in mid-2018. But their usage does not seem very sophisticated:

- They appear to be using an older or incorrectly-configured Assistant (it did not respond to my queries; maybe a billing issue?)
- No API integration
